# smart_wallpaper
This program is a smart wallpaper changer, it downloads the 'Photo of the Day' from the National Geographic website, checks whether the image size is similar to the resolution of the monitor and changes the wallpaper accordingly.
If the dimensions of the image are not similar to the resolution of the monitor, it asks for confirmation from the user whether to proceed with the change or not and works accordingly.

The script requires PIL, BeautifulSoup, urllib modules to run.

Note: The program is made and tested on Windows.
